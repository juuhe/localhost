echo "\n<p>\nJAMA is a proposed standard matrix class for Java. The JAMA introduction \ndescribes \"JAMA : A Java Matrix Package\" in this way:\n</p> \n\n<blockquote>\nJAMA is a basic linear algebra package for Java. It provides user-level classes for \nconstructing and manipulating real, dense matrices.  It is meant to provide sufficient \nfunctionality for routine problems, packaged in a way that is natural and understandable \nto non-experts.  It is intended to serve as the standard matrix class for Java, and \nwill be proposed as such to the Java Grande Forum and then to Sun.  A straightforward \npublic-domain reference implementation has been developed by the MathWorks and NIST as \na strawman for such a class.  We are releasing this version in order to obtain public \ncomment. There is no guarantee that future versions of JAMA will be compatible with this one.  \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe development team below has successfully ported the JAMA API to PHP.  You can explore \nthis site to learn more about this project and it's current development status.\n</p>\n\n";
